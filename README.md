## What's the deal with the name?

Budapest is the capital of Hungary and is our hometown. It was created in 1873 by merging Ã“buda, **Buda and Pest**. **Budi**, on the other hand, is a slang word for toilets. The rest is up to you... (Alternative name ideas would include Loondon or Honolua)

## App features

Budipest is a community-based toilet finder app that seeks to alleviate the problem of public toilets in Hungary by making existing toilets more visible, and displaying restrooms in clubs and bars that are open to anyone.

The main features of Budipest:

- See restrooms around you on a map and in a list
- Check the opening hours of restrooms, and their main features (eg. free or paid, price of entry, accessibility, etc.)
- Rate toilets or add helpful comments to them
- Anyone can add new toilets to the app

## Contributing

We created Budipest with our small team in our spare time, so any help is welcome. If you fixed a bug, made a new feature, translated the app for a new language or just fixed a typo, create a pull request and I'll be sure to check it out and merge it once it's ready to be merged.

If you want to contribute but don't have any feature ideas, check out our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/EZNASMNg/budipest). (If you find a card that seems interesting and isn't translated to Hungarian, don't hesitate to contact us!)
